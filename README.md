# FCN simple implementation
This project is PyTorch implementation of [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038) .
We mainly implemented the FCN8s in the paper, using ResNet-34 as the network backbone. The dataset we selected is a 
small dataset, you can click [here](https://github.com/bat67/pytorch-FCN-easiest-demo#%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E9%9B%86) to
 get information about the dataset.
